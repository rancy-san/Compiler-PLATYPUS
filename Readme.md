## Compiler (PLATYPUS)

### Description:
Compilers run under a specific computer architecture, so if you change the specs, you need a different compiler for that computer. We have standards due to different OS, and architectures. Deprecation still compiles but is not supported due to errors in the code. Compilers are a small subset of the processor. Compilers are related only to computers, and to programming tasks. There are plenty of other places compilers are built in. When writing your program in the IDE, the IDE tells you something is wrong (static checks). The front end of the compiler is built in your editor. If you want to run the compiler to build the program it also tells you something is wrong, but it can also tell you the errors before you compile as shown while you write code. Compilers use every single data structure and more. In order to build the compiler, the OS, and the architecture of the computer needs to be known. This compiler program containing the buffer, scanner, and parser, allows the user to code in the PLATYPUS langauge.

### Folders:
The compiler is split into three parts/folders, the Buffer, the Scanner, the Parser. Each folder has a readme explain a more in-depth purpose to the file.
